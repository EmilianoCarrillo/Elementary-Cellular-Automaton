# Elementary Cellular Automaton 
This is the simplest type of cellular automata. It just has one dimension and each cell can be either alive or dead. It was invented by Stephen Wolfram. 

My desktop app uses Javascript and P5 to replicate it and experiment with it. (Available for Windows and Mac).
It was written on Javascript and the P5 framework. I used the electron tool in order to make a desktop application.
Feel free to modify the app in any way possible. If you distribute please aknowledge me.

## Getting Started
### RECOMMENDED
You can just go and **[Try the app on your browser by following this link.](https://emiliano-carrillo.github.io/Elementary-Cellular-Automaton)** 

You can also try and install the desktop application by following some instructions of the [Electron Documentation](https://electron.atom.io/docs/) or [these awesome tutorials by Christian Engvall](https://www.christianengvall.se/electron-packager-tutorial/).

## (Fast forward) Installing once you have the BuildPackager and installers
### Mac instructions
Just click on the dmg file and drag the app into the applications folder once the dmg window shows up. That's it.

### Windows instructions
Click on the exe file. Sorry, it is a little buggy. It will probably tell you that there is a problem running the program but just close the dialogue boxes and be patient. At the end it will  run with no errors. If it doesn't just repeat the process.
